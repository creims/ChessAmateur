#include "logistics.h"

// Includes pre-generated arrays to speed up move generation, check checks, and validation
// This code seeks to minimize overhead because AI move generation spends most of its time generating moves
// and checking for check/checkmate - over 90% according to profiling

// Works by indexing into an array representing rows, columns, or diagonals
// Since 2 directions use the same rows, columns, and diagonals, use dirIncrement(Dir)
// to obtain the correct increment

// For example, to check for the nearest piece to the west from square S, iterate through e_w_squares:

// int inc = dirIncrement(WEST);
// for(i = w_indices[S]; ; i += inc) {
//   Square checked = e_w_squares[i];
//   if(checked == INVALID_SQUARE) { ... } // there is no piece west of S
//   Piece p = gamestate[checked];
//   if(p != NO_PIECE { ... } // checked is the nearest occupied square, and the piece on it is p
// }

// OR, using dirPtr to find the squares west of 34:

// Direction dir = WEST;
// Square S = 34, inDir;
// int inc = dirIncrement(dir);
// for(Square const* p = dirPtr(dir, s); (inDir = *p) != INVALID_SQUARE; p += inc) { ... } // inDir is the square
